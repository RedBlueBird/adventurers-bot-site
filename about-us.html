	<div class="boring-monologue">
		<p>Why did we spent so much effort to as far as 2.5 years? Well, it was begun as just a simple idea. Me and my friends used to play a choice-based DnD style game by texting in discord, where the dungeon-master writes a prompt at the beginning, gives a series of options for the players to choose and players decide the ending of each choice they make. I also just started learning to code at that time as well, so I thought "Why not make this automated, so less wrist works for us, while also honing my coding skills". </p>

		</div>

		<p>Although when things are automated, there will be lot less flexiblity and creativity invovled in the gameplay. But we still tried to make it as interesting as possible. Me and crispy first started the idea of Birds Bot, where the player tame different species of birds and make the birds to fly as far as they can in one run. Each type of bird has their own unique abilities, and for every dash the birds make in their flight, they will either encounter an obstacle, some treasures, or other events.</p>

		<div class="shadow screenshot">

		</div>

		<p>As my programming skills starts to develop, I was able to code more complicated features. It is at that time Crispy introduced me to another person named Kay, who once was a OG beta tester for the Boxbot. He thinks this bot shares the same vision as the Boxbot once did, but has far more potential. He suggested me to revamp the bot into an Adventure RPG where the player can tame not just birds, but also other creatures and mystical beasts, while also carrying shields and weapons. And so... the Adventurers Bot 1.0 was born.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Kay also owned a huge boxbot giveaway server during that time. He made a shoutout to my bot and some people notably two users Dragon and Chomusuke started to help and support me to develop the bot. The progress went notably well, we added more biomes, stronger and cooler beasts to tame, different weapons with unique movesets. One year has passed, once signficiant issues began to rise and troubling our team. Because the bot was written in python, all the player datas was stored in a json structure. It will be harder to implement features with json compared to databases as more datas are loaded in. Due to my poor core implementations at the very start, if players change their username, or randomly delete some messages, the bot will glitch out. And despite many variant and unique playstyles the bot has to offer, once players played enough of them, they will get bored after seeing them over and over again.</p>

		</div>

		<p>The failure of the base line implementation called us for another yet revamp, forcing us to invent new solutions. There were already plenty RPG bots in the discord bot list, and we always want to be unique and special. After some days of discussions, we started the Adventurers Bot 2.0. We had the idea of collecting cards, level up, get more cards and create a deck out of them. People can battle each other by playing different cards. For example a card named Stab will do some regular damage to the opponent, while a special card named Flashy Fireworks will do multiple low damage hits while also applying an effects called Burn.</p>

		<p>Kay also introduced me to another friend of his, Narwall. Narwall is a programmer, ideas spammer, and a weeb. He gave me tons of helpful feedbacks and suggestions. He made it possible so instead of just 1 player versus another identity, people are able to fight in different teams in different amount up to 6. This is revolutionary, as this not only opened more depth of strategy for players to explore, but also more variants in adventures.</p>

		</div>

		<p>As the time moved on, we added more cards, more effects, more creatures to fight against, and boss raids. We even created a starting safe location called Hometown that connects all the adventure areas in the Adventure Map! Players could also try to fish, play blackjack, and do other mini-games in this location as well. Everything went well, until another year passed. We released our first version of the Bot in Ocotober 2020, its only then we realized the difficulty of advertising a bot compared to advertising a server. We tried to come up with a solution, but it didn't re... (Last updated 11/8/20)</p>
