	<div class="boring-monologue">
		<p>Why did we put so much effort into this bot over the course of 2.5 years? Well, it began as just a simple idea. My friends and I used to play a choice-based DnD style game by texting in discord, where the dungeon-master would write a prompt, give a series of options for the players to choose, and players would decide the ending by the choices they made. I had just started learning to code at that time, so I thought "Why not make this automated - less work for us, while allowing me to hone my coding skills". </p>

		</div>

		<p>When things are automated, there is a lot less flexiblity and creativity involved in the gameplay. However, we still tried to make it as interesting as possible for players. Crispy and I first started the idea of Bird's Bot, where the players tame different species of birds and attempt to make the birds to fly as far as they can in one run. Each type of bird has its own unique abilities, and for every dash the birds make in their flight, they will either encounter an obstacle, treasure, or other events.</p>

		</div>

		<p>As my programming skills began to develop, I was able to code more complicated features. It was at this time that Crispy introduced me to another person named Kay. He believed that this bot shared the same vision as Boxbot once did, but had far more potential. He suggested that I revamp the bot into an Adventure based RPG where the player could tame not just birds, but also other creatures and mystical beasts, while also carrying shields and weapons. And so... the Adventurers Bot 1.0 was born.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Kay also owned a boxbot giveaway server at that time. He made a shoutout to my bot and some people, notably two users named Dragon and Chomusuke, joined to help and support the development of the bot. The progress went well as we added more biomes, stronger and cooler beasts to tame, and different weapons with unique movesets. One year had passed since the creation of the original bot, but then signficiant issues began to rise, troubling our team. Because the bot was written in python, all the player data was stored in a json structure. It would be harder to implement features with json compared to other databases as more data was loaded in. Due to my poor core implementations at the very beginning, if players changed their username, or randomly deleted some messages, the bot would glitch. Additionally, despite many variants and unique playstyles the bot had to offer, once players had played enough of them, they would get bored seeing the same things over and over again.</p>

		</div>

		<p>The failure of the base line implementation called for another yet revamp, forcing us to come up with new solutions. There were already plenty of RPG bots in the discord bot list, so we wanted ours to be unique and special. After some days of discussions, we started Adventurers Bot 2.0, which is the current version. We had the idea of collecting cards, leveling up, getting more cards and creating decks out of them. People could battle each other by playing different cards. For example a card named Stab would do some regular damage to the opponent, while a special card named Flashy Fireworks could do multiple low damage hits while also applying an effects called Burn.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Kay then introduced me to another friend of his, Narwall. Narwall is a programmer, idea spammer, and a weeb. He gave me tons of helpful feedback and suggestions. He made it possible for battles to have up to 6 entities instead of just one player versus another entity. This was revolutionary, as it not only opened up more depth of strategy for players to explore, but also more variants of encounters in adventures.</p>

		</div>

		<p>As time moved on, we added more cards, more effects, more creatures to fight against, and boss raids. We even created a safe starting location called Hometown that connects all the adventure areas in the Adventure Map! Players could also try to fish, play blackjack, and do other mini-games in different locations as well. Everything went well, until another year passed. We had released our first version of Adventures Bot in Ocotober 2020, and it was then that we realized the difficulty of advertising a bot. We tried to come up with a solution, but it didn't re...
